Example to show that LL(1) does not necessarily encode
the correct choices for any given input string, due to the 
fact that follow is essentially an overapproximation
(different occurrences of the non-terminal are confused).

S -> aXa.
S -> bXb.
X -> .

follow(X) = { a, b }

     a         b
S  S -> aXa   S -> bXb

X  S -> .     S -> .

ab

S -> aXa -> aa
