# Strings and Languages

{: .defn }
An __alphabet__ is any finite set, whose members are called __letters__ (equivalently: *symbols* or *characters*).  We typically use $\Sigma$ to denote a generic alphabet and $a,b,c,d$ as variables that stand for the letters.

{: .defn }
A __string__ (equivalently: *word*) over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is a finite sequence of characters from $\Sigma$.  The sequence may be empty, and we write the __empty string__ as $\epsilon$.  We typically use $u,v,w,x,y,z$ as variables that stand for a string.

For example, $\mathsf{hello}$ is a string over the alphabet $$\{\mathsf{a},\mathsf{b},\mathsf{c},\ldots,\mathsf{y},\mathsf{z}\}$$, but $\mathsf{Hello}$ is not.  Another string over the same alphabet is $\mathsf{abbbbb}$ and another is $\epsilon$.  Strings over the alphabet $$\{▽,△\}$$ include $\mathord{\bigtriangleup}\mathord{\bigtriangleup}\mathord{▽}$ and $\bigtriangledown$.  Strings over the alphabet $$\{\mathsf{oh},\mathsf{really}\}$$ in which each letter is one of these two strings, include $\mathsf{oh}\mathsf{really}$ and $\mathsf{really}\mathsf{oh}\mathsf{really}$, but not $\mathsf{ohr}$.

{: .defn }
The set of __all strings over the alphabet $\Sigma$__ is written $\Sigma^*$, this always includes $\epsilon$.  

Now we consider some operations on strings.

{: .defn }
The __length__ of a string $w$, written $\|w\|$, is just the number of characters in the string.  That is, if $w = a_1\cdots{}a_k$ then $\|w\| = k$.

{: .defn }
Given strings $u$ and $v$, we write $uv$ for the string obtained by __concatenating__ $v$ to the end of $u$.  That is, if $u = a_1\cdots{}a_k$ and $v = b_1 \cdots{} b_m$ then $uv = a_1\cdots{}a_k b_1 \cdots{} b_m$.  We write $w^k$ for the __$k$-fold concatenation__ of $w$ with itself, i.e. the word $\underbrace{ww\cdots{}w}_{\text{$k$-times}}$.

We will use concatenation and variables to describe the shape of strings abstractly, just as we use arithmetic operators and variables to describe numbers abstractly.  For example, to say that a string $u$ over the alphabet $$\{a,b\}$$ contains at least two occurrences of $a$, we can say that:

> $u$ is of shape $w_1aw_2aw_3$  

More precisely, with this form of words -- "of shape" -- we are saying that _there exist_ strings $$w_1,w_2,w_3 \in \{a,b\}^*$$ such that $u = w_1 a w_2 a w_3$ (i.e. $u$ is exactly the concatenation of $w_1$ followed by an $a$ followed by $w_2$ followed by an $a$ followed by $w_3$).  Every string over this alphabet that contains at least two $a$ can be decomposed in this way (there may be several ways, generally), for example:

| String | Decomposition as $w_1aw_2aw_3$ |
| $bbabab$ | $w_1 = bb$, $w_2 = b$, $w_3 = b$ |
| $abbaa$  | $w_1 = \epsilon$, $w_2 = bba$, $w_3 = \epsilon$ |
| $aaabbb$  | $w_1 = \epsilon$, $w_2 = \epsilon$, $w_3 = abbb$ |

Compare this with how you would say that an integer $n$ is even: _$n$ is of shape $2*m$ (for some $m$)_.

{: .defn }
A string $w$ is said to be a __substring__ of a string $v$ just if $w$ appears consecutively in $v$, more precisely: $v$ has shape $v_1wv_2$

For example, $aab$ is a substring of $aaabbb$ but it's not a substring of $abab$.  On the other hand $a$ is a substring of both (typically, we are not too concerned about distinguishing between $a$ the letter and $a$ the string consisting of a single letter).  We also have that $\epsilon$ is a substring of any string (over any alphabet).

{: .defn }
We will refer to a set of strings over a certain alphabet as a __language__.

We will often use such decompositions in combination with set notation, to describe languages of strings that all have a certain shape.  For example:
  * $$\{w_1 a w_2 a w_3 \mid w_1, w_2, w_3 \in \{a,b\}^* \}$$ - the set of all strings over $$\{a,b\}$$ containing at least two $a$
  * $$\{w_1 a w_2 a w_3 \mid w_1, w_2, w_3 \in \{b\}^* \}$$ - the set of all strings over $$\{a,b\}$$ containing exactly two $a$
  * $$\{vw \mid v,w \in \{0,1\}^* \ \text{and}\ \lvert v \rvert = \lvert w \rvert \}$$ - the set of all strings over $$\{0,1\}$$ that are of even length.
  * $$\{ 0u01u10u0 \mid u \in \{0,1\}^* \}$$ - the set of all strings over $\{0,1\}$ that are formed by repeating a substring three times consecutively, with the first wrapped in 0s, the second in 1s and the third in 0s
  * $$\{ uv \mid u,v \in \{0,1\}^* \ \text{and}\  \#_0(u) = \#_1(v) \}$$ -
  * $$\{ 0^ku0^k \mid u \in \{0,1\}^* \ \text{and}\ k > 0 \}$$ -

Note! Do not confuse, e.g. $$\{w_1 a w_2 a w_3 \mid w_1, w_2, w_3 \in \{a,b\}^* \}$$ with $$\{w_1 a w_2 a w_3\}$$: the latter is a singleton set, it contains the string $$w_1 a w_2 a w_2$$ as its only element (and for that to make sense we must have introduced $w_1$, $w_2$ and $w_3$ already).  E.g.

> Suppose, $w_1 = a$, $w_2 =aa$ and $w_3 = aaa$.  Then my FAVOURITE set is $$\{w_1aw_2aw_3\}$$, which I just ADORE because its ONE AND ONLY element is $aaaaaaaa$.
