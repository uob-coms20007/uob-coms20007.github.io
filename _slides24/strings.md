## Strings

{: .defn }
An __alphabet__ is any finite set, whose members are called __letters__ (equivalently: *symbols* or *characters*).  We typically use $\Sigma$ to denote a generic alphabet and $a,b,c,d$ as variables that stand for the letters.

{: .defn }
A __string__ (equivalently: *word*) over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is a finite sequence of characters from $\Sigma$.  The sequence may be empty, and we write the __empty string__ as $\epsilon$.  We typically use $u,v,w,x,y,z$ as variables that stand for a string.

{: .defn }
The set of __all strings over the alphabet $\Sigma$__ is written $\Sigma^*$, this always includes $\epsilon$.  We will refer to a set of strings as a __language__.
