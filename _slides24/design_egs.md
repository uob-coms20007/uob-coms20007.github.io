1. $$\{ w \mid \text{$w$ is any word over $\{0,1\}$}\}$$
1. $$\{ w \mid \text{$w$ contains at least three letter 1} \}$$
1. $$\{ w \mid \text{$w$ starts and ends with the same symbol} \}$$
1. $$\{ w \mid \text{the length of $w$ is odd and its middle letter is $0$}\}$$
1. $$\{ w \mid \text{$w$ is a palindrome (i.e. the same word when reversed)}\}$$
1. $$\{uv \mid |u| = |v| \text{ and } u \neq v^R\}$$

(in the lecture, this last example accidentally had condition $u \neq v$)
